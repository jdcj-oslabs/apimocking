Interspect is an API-mocking tool that helps you ensure data interoperability between microservices and arbitrary API endpoints. [Download the app](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Interspect/releases/download/1.0.0/Interspect-macOS-x64.zip) for macOS to get started.

## Basic usage
The app is split into three, distinct panels:

### Source
This is where you can define a data source that will become the foundation for your data mockups. There are a couple ways to get data  into the application.

#### Send a GET request
If your microservice supports `GET` requests, add your endpoint to the request bar and hit send. Youâ€™ll then be able to view the response data, along with basic performance metrics for the request.

#### Send data to Interspect
You can also send data to the source panel at `http://localhost:3001/posturl` with `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`.

**Note:** The open socket may timeout after extended use. Thereâ€™s an [open issue](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Interspect/issues/94) to resolve (and we welcome contributions ðŸ˜‰)

#### Accpeted data types
Interspect works with `JSON` and `XML`-formatted data

### Mockups
In the mockups panel, you can create new data scenarios from your source data. Each data tree is editable so you can delete, update, or add new data.

If your data source is a collection, you can also create new mockups from a specific index or key.

#### Creating test assertions
You can add test assertions to any mockup as well. Simply click **Edit Test Assertions** and choose a specific status code or status code range that you expect to receive when sending your mockup to your destination microservice.

While only status code assertions are supported at launch, we welcome contributions to add additional test domains.

### Destination
In the third panel, you can enter a destination endpoint for your mock data. When you send your request, each mockup you created will be sent in sequence to the destination endpoint.

Upon a successful request, you will be able to see returned status codes as well as the result of any test assertions and basic performance metrics. 

**Note:** HTTP Requests in the destination panel are sent 10 times to get an average of the total request time. At launch, this behavior cannot be turned off, but a [preference will be added in a future version](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Interspect/issues/95).
